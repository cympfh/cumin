# Array

An Array is a Value data containing zero or more elements in order.
It is required that all elements have same types,
therefore any Array can be called an Array of type `T` where `T` is the type of elements.

For example,
the following is an Array of `Int`.

```rust,noplaypen
[
    1,
    2,
    -3,
    4 - 4,
]
```

The type of this data is `Array<Int>`.
